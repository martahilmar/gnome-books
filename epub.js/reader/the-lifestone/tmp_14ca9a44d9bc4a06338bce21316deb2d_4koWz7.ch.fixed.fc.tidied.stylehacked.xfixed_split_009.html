<p class="western">The creatures had carpeted the dead dusty
land from the base of the mountains to the first of the dead
torched corpses. Thousands of them scattered across the mighty
plain, then the gaps that they created in their number filled in as
more of the minions poured along the black road, they spread out,
much like spilled blood on a hard floor. Nailstead, I knew, would
be somewhere in the mountain range, watching and directing his
army. He would pour more and more creatures onto the plain, filling
it up, creating a sea of evil bloated bodies, which would break
like waves onto our defenses.</p>
<p class="western">Though the tactic was not very original or
inventive, it was potent with the possibility of destroying any
resistance that we might place before it. Shear weight of numbers
would force us to retreat, and defensive positions would become
useless to us as creatures closed in upon them. Killing thousands
would only create space for more to file out. I had no way of
knowing how many or how large the force facing us could be, all I
knew was that each of them opposed me and mine wanting to see us
gone, left decimated and destroyed. All that I knew for certain was
that Nailstead has been in those mountains for longer than twenty
years, continually building, planning, forming and constructing his
army. Drawing to him all that had been disillusioned or turned, all
that felt natural evil to be the best over life and freedom for
all.</p>
<p class="western">Every life form that feared normalcy had
hoarded to Nailstead's never ending call. Creature from darkness
had swarmed up from the center of the world traveling the deep
hidden passageways which led from the underworld, always seeking
out and joining forces with Nailstead. He would be able to summon a
seemingly endless number of minions to fight his war, whilst we the
defenders, would be restricted by the number of troops that were
available. We had called and summoned throughout the lands,
thousands had responded, but thousands against possibly millions
did not seem to be viable, yet we would fight for our right to
live, as Nailstead would fight for his right to rule and to see us
die.</p>
<p class="western">My troops were in place ready to rebuff the
first surges. Ariel spear throwers and archers would dive to attack
the rear of the ranks on the crowded plain, trying to creating a
buffer zone of dead creatures. Fire cartons would be released to
plummet to the ground there to scatter and coat, each filled with
burning tar, hopefully adding to the confusion and creating
incinerated death as the forces start to maneuver. I look up seeing
only clouds forming in the high sky, my Magi have woven their
spells well, the camouflage is perfect, the sky warriors have
returned unseen to wait for the ideal and anointed moment. Soon the
sky would explode in war cries as wave upon wave of sky riders
surged out of the camouflage directly into the marching heart of
Nailstead's attacking force, causing their own form of
devastation.</p>
<p class="western">Soon the time would be upon us, the last
hopes entered into, the battle engaged fully. Many would die on
both sides, slaughtered to a cause that is both pointless and
disturbing to the will of man, and elf alike. Yet it was a battle
which must be engaged in if life as it is known to us is to exist.
Without the battle being fought, if life as we know it with all its
hopes and flaws was to remain constant, then this battle was a
necessary consequence of those desires and must be both fought and
won.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">My thoughts wondered back through time as I
waited for the battle to commence. I remember being a child, small
in physical stature which made the rearing crevice seem even higher
and therefore more intimidating. I walked on, edged forward by an
invisible touch, my path lit by burning sconces set regular into
the wall on alternating sides of the passageway. Before me was
another door, not the sort of door that this place implied should
be infront of me. It was thin, weedy looking, as though a slight
shove would push it from its hinges to the floor.</p>
<p class="western">The wood looked frail, eaten into by
thousands of termites, over thousands of years, I hesitated to
touch it less it crumble before me. With no option but to push on,
and with the unseen hand guiding my presence, I reached forward to
gently touch the ancient wood. My fingers tingled; the feeling
crept up my arm before I could pull my hand away. Nothing happened,
I just stood there studying the wood, listening for anything, ready
to run, but terrified of what I would find if I ran. I had doubts
as to whether I could run if I really wanted to, doubts that seemed
set in stone and beyond my ability to fight even were I to decide
to resist the call and push towards and through that door.</p>
<p class="western">Before me the door swung open and a light
flicked on, driving away shadows caused by the flickering fire held
safely in the wall mounted sconces behind me. My own shadow had
briefly been visible infront of me, it seemed to my childish mind
to be telling me to get out, leave, go now whilst you can, run boy
run! I ignored it, I had no other choice, I had to believe that I
had been brought to this place for a reason, a good reason or so I
hoped. I restrained my desires and stood looking forwards accepting
my fate, accepting the guidance being given to me.</p>
<p class="western">I walked slowly towards the now open door, as
my shadow fell further forwards I noticed that it begin to vanish
as it passed through the door. Beyond the frame I could see exactly
nothing, not even my shadow. No light burst on to illuminate the
way. I closed, my fear building, two steps to go still no light,
one step, still no light, then I had reached the frame, I hesitate
with my foot lifted as though to step through into the dark. Even
this close there was nothing to see, the door seemed to be the
entry to nowhere.</p>
<p class="western">If I put my foot down on the other side of
the frame would it continue to go down, past the floor level,
tipping me forwards into a never ending plummet. Or would there be
sound but invisible ground for my foot to rest on? There was only
one way that I could ever know, but it took a certain kind of
courage, a bravery that I was not certain that I contained. Slowly
I lowered my foot, whilst grasping each side of the stone door
frame tightly lest I plunge forward, at least there would be my
hands and their grip to save me. My foot found firm ground beyond
the doorway; much to my relief, I step further in letting go of the
frame reluctantly.</p>
<p class="western">Lights exploded around me for the briefest of
time then they vanished; my body tingled from the nails on my toes
to the tips of my longest hair on my head. The feeling was
encompassing, every cell of my body felt its draw and power. I was
still standing in pitch darkness. The floor below me was invisible
though my toes told me that it was there. My hands waved about me,
trying to feel something, anything, they failed.</p>
<p class="western">"Welcome boy, you have finally arrived I
see!"</p>
<p class="western">The voice echoed all around me, sounding
hollow and eerie to my ears, and I wondered how could the speaker
see anything, I couldn't! Lightening flashed from behind me
exploding into a brilliant white light that was tinged with
electric blue, it spread across the surface of the rock walls
surrounding me, walls that I was stood facing. To my surprise the
wall vanishes revealing a magnificent view out over the distant
plain and on to the mountains beyond, from where I have been told
that I walked out of. I cannot remember anything prior to being met
by the guard and then taken from there onward to this point, this
meeting.</p>
<p class="western">The air shimmered briefly before clearing
once more, the view remained the same, but now I got the feeling
that there was something between it and me, something invisible,
but there all the same. I turned away from the view wanting to look
towards where I had heard the voice come from, and where the
lightening had originated from.</p>
<p class="western">The room has been illuminated by the creation
of the wall into a window. Now visible to me and sitting in a stone
chair looking much like a statue herself, was a woman. She I knew
had to be the one to which I had been brought, the witch, the
Morganith, the wise woman of the mountains, she that had many
names, all equally powerful, though others being more ancient than
the name that is now used to describe her.</p>
<p class="western">I stand upright, my spine pulled straight, a
lowly boy child before a creature that has both extreme age and
wisdom at her command. Let alone the power to turn stone walls into
open airy windows, a power to be respected, if not feared, a power
not to be challenged by me, but accepted as right and proper in
this place.</p>
<p class="western">"Why boy do you think that you have the right
to replace the heir to the rights of ruler?"</p>
<p class="western">"I don't" I mumbled shocked at her question,
I have no wish to de-throne anyone, let alone the rightful heir to
anything.</p>
<p class="western">"Speak up child!"</p>
<p class="western">I repeat my statement, this time with more
force and determination in the simple words.</p>
<p class="western">"I DON'T!"</p>
<p class="western">She looked at me a cracking of skin across
her brittle face. In any other person I would have thought that
they were smiling, but in her, the action seemed more reminiscent
of a parchment page ripping. Still she fixed her eyes on me, still
she studied my presence as though trying to read my deepest
thoughts.</p>
<p class="western">The milky ness of old age coated her
eyeballs, adding to the terrifying effect that her demeanor created
as I looked into her face.</p>
<p class="western">"That is good, very good!" Her voice
crackled.</p>
<p class="western">I was in no doubt that she was ancient and
powerful, no doubt at all, it oozed from her, it swelled her body
as it filled her eyes which burned with her power in evidence.</p>
<p class="western">"You will make a great leader for our people,
exactly as I have foreseen! You will be the power that will first
unify and eventually over see the end of our way of life."</p>
<p class="western">What she said that I would do seemed to be
contradictive, I nearly decided to challenge her but just before I
spoke she raised herself from the stone throne on which she had
been sitting.</p>
<p class="western">"Walk with me boy, come learn of the future
that is yours by right, understand, see the lands that you and you
alone shall hold dominion over. Come boy be brave, become the true
King."</p>
<p class="western">She led me across the room towards the open
vista of the rolling plain and beyond. Something shimmered between
us and the drop off, a slim upright of granite appeared.</p>
<p class="western">Sitting on top of this granite up thrust,
resting safely in a depression clearly ground out to fit it, was a
round slightly glowing object. She, the witch, led me towards the
object, as we closed it changed, clearing to form a liquid crystal,
which changed and altered continually, forming and reforming it's
shape. Held in place by an invisible barrier, a barrier created of
nothing. The ball looked to me as though it were constructed of
crystal clear water, living moving water, water without a coast or
river bed to meet and travel upon. Water balanced upon a rock, held
and waiting through time for my arrival. The thought frightened me
because it foretold off a destiny about which I knew nothing, a
destiny I was not certain that I wanted to understand or
accept.</p>
<p class="western">Little did or could I know then as I gazed
into the crystal, exactly how much and for how long this entity
would have dominion over my life. I would realise only when as a
full grown man and ruler of my kingdom that it would be this
crystal and the power it contained, which would aide me to bring
peace to my world and control the evil that would threaten it.</p>
<p class="western">This stone of water that the witch was
introducing me to, could do all of this and much more. Many years
from now, at the eve of a dire battle, when all could be lost
forever, this stone of liquid would fill my mind, create in it a
plan of action and if I used it correctly, it might save all good
life, whilst protecting, by binding away all evil. Time would pass
slowly, but the crystal so long as it is protected, would continue
on. Carrying its bound creatures, in a world of living, but
restrained, onward through the coming centuries.</p>
<p class="western">"This is the one crystal, the only one of its
kind known to man or elf. This is to be the Lifestone or stone of
light," The witch informed me.</p>
<p class="western">I, a child looked upon the oscillating power
in awe, feeling it reach out and connect with my thoughts. The
stone sucked at my mind, pushed aside the tendrils of mental
confusion and childhood, entering into my body and soul. Not
exactly taking control, but engendering a feeling of wellbeing and
balance. I fought the entry at first, I struggled hard against it,
but I relaxed as the witch lightly rested her bony hand on my
shoulders, reassuring me.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">The field of conflict lay prepared for
wasting infront of me, the field of battle had taken shape and the
soldiers were ready to sell their lives as was to be decided by the
fates. The legends had come to the point that they were no longer
just legends, they had stepped over the line into reality, and now
I face the enemy as ready and as able as I could be, though not
certain of the outcome. I like many generals looked out over the
situation as it developed and I like them had my doubts and my
concerns. I knew the weaknesses of my forces and had some idea of
the strengths laid against me. I could now only wait for the time
to come, the battle to be engaged, and react as I saw fit to each
eventuality or twist in the coming conflict.</p>
<p class="western">Nailstead's second wave of troops scattered
fully across the plain to either side of the black road. The time
had arrived to strike. High up above the milling enemy circled my
sky warriors. My divided forces to left and right waited hidden in
a mist of wafting invisibility. Occasionally, I noted, with concern
that the mists created to hide my troops wavered too much providing
brief glimpses of the concealed, which worryingly became visible to
me. Would Nailstead wherever he had chosen to create his command
post, also be able to see the hidden defenders. Would he realise
the trap into which he was thrusting his forces, had he got a
counter ploy, was he expecting a maneuver of this kind from me, did
he have a defense?</p>
<p class="western">Like all generals charged with commanding
armies, I worried that my planning might fail. I like previous
combatants understood that the initial placement of forces depended
on stealth; I believed that I had succeeded in that aim, now it
only remained to wait for the exactly perfect second to engage and
hopefully decimate my enemy. I intend to sweep my troops in from
either side, whilst my enemies attention was diverted by the aerial
force's attack. With their attention fixated high above my soldiers
should be able to close, encircle and destroy, Nailstead's dark
minions. Many would die this afternoon, but if luck was with me, I
should, according to my plan emerge the victor.</p>
<p class="western"> <br class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="western">High in the mountains, concealed from all
sight, the coven had formed, the witch prepared the crystal, formed
it into a binding entity with one aim in its existence.</p>
<p class="western">I knew this; it concerned me because of the
potential for this deep magic to become a threat to all life, not
just my intended enemy. I had finally agreed to the stone being
activated, but under well meant duress from both the witch and
council of elders, still the thought of its awesome power being
released scared me witless.</p>
<p class="western">They truly believed that it would be possible
to create a permanent place of restraint. To lock the minions of
Nailstead out from this world, in to the dark of another, thus
ending this war and all future wars. They argued that I must
consider two things. The first was if I lost the battle then what
would remain to fight the dark one? What force could quell his
intentions and destroy his ambitions? They believed that nothing
could, unless the crystal was formed unless it was allowed to
fulfill its ancient promise.</p>
<p class="western">Secondly they argued; what would I do with
the prisoners were I to win? Would it be a massacre, would our
people take the bloody road to damnation and destroy every living
creature that had opposed us? They could never be allowed to roam
free; they could not be tolerated to regroup, for in time they
would find another leader if Nailstead had been removed, and then,
we as a people would be facing their evil intent once more. That
was a situation I could not allow to happen, they were right on
both counts but still I had my doubts about setting free such
ancient magic on my pleasant peaceful lands. Once free it might
remain free and then what would be the outcome for all who just
wanted to live their lives.</p>
<p class="western">They had made valid points; I had listened
intently keeping my doubts to my self. That was the time that I
realized that I had not thought much past the impending
confrontation. I, the King of this world had failed to think ahead,
they the council to my kingship had not. The witch was charged with
construction of the crystal, forming it initially as either an
ultimate defense against defeat, or as a container to house those
that had been defeated. I had agreed reluctantly but there had been
no other choice once the future had been considered. I knew nothing
of the witches true intent of the power she intended to claim of
the nature of her desires.</p>
